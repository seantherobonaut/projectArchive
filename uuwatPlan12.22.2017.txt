Has-A relationship
Root has Child that Has content... Root->child = new Template(Named constant) find out how to do that again

Use get request(s) to load correct Root template

On the child template, have single or multiple pieces grab content using user data, and get/session requests


get selected dataID row (pass to functions by refernce)
	$data
	$output = empty for now

pass object by reference to permission checker
	search permission table for permissions, default is public
	if permission passes, make output display data

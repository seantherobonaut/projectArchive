make an array that stores a que of operations and executes them with a delays...but to get accurate measures
the loops must start by passing the width of the html to the functions and any other stored variables it needs
so no matter how much the screen changes, it will always eventaully grab the last width measured and catch up

it is like starting an equation that is a big engine, and it instaltly without delay grabs the correct html width

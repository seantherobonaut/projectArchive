will it affect other timers? do several timers at once

make timer that can be run like this startTimer(nameOfTimer, customFunction, delay, repetitions)

3 timers

run stuff each rep (no exec after)

only execute something after

run each rep and execute soemthing eafter


store all functions in an array
and execute each item with a delay

push all funcsions to an array

myarray.push

myarray[0]();

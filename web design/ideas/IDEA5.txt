make sure when window size is changed it changes all major elements

rename header and navbar and navlinks

hover script for navlinks

make so the page only refreshes on desktops (detect this if the navlinks need to collapes) &&
	only if the window has moved 10 pixels in either direction
		(store current and previous values in an array to compare)

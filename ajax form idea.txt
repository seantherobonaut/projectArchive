ajax form idea

when you click on the edit button (that only appears if you are logged in and have access)
	it modifies the values on a hidden form and toggles a popup. that gets the contents of the datatag

<p id="location1">
	<?php echo content(7)['text']?>
</p>
button - toggleform type, target

__SERVER__ ...well I don't want to style it serverside????
array something
foreach()
{
	html = <?php rowVar = rowDataID7?>
		<article1 rowVar_id>!!!! style everything under the id name
			<img1 rowVar_img1>
				<text2 rowVar_text2>
			<img2 rowVar_img2>
				<text3 rowVar_text3>
		</article1>
			<form button data>

	array_push(something, html);

}

__CLIENT__
styles for each id

echo something[1]['content']
	echo something[1]['form']...or a method! that will ONLY return forms if the conditions are met!
		!!!...problem not all condtions for each paragraph are the same
			you can solve this by making object specific permissions? adminPara, memberPara
				maybe pass different objects to the ParaContent class to dictate how the forms behave and look
echo something[2]
echo something[3]

There will be no seperate html at the bottom of the page waiting to be specified by the form. 
A javascript function will create html that will be the form. A popup. Or a box after. It does all that. 

$paraContent->bundle(rowID, htmlType, formType(popup/box/etc..))
The second and third parameters can be inserted into an array shortly after instantation of the object?
	$paraContent->newHTMLoption("name", php object that follows an interface)
	$paraContent->newFORMoption("name", or javascrip file)
The permissions can be passed to the first instantiation of the object.
Rather than having each method be wrapped in permissions, just make a new object with different permissions. Think of it this way, most
content wrapers won't have different permssions between them unless it is user comments, you can worry about that later. 

Unless specificed by methods or the constructor(bad idea), all permissions are free. They will default be true. True can mean many things, 
it can control wether or not to display the content, control if the form toggle button is seen, and wether or not to load javascript files
specific to each action. Headers:newjs("path/to/popup.js")(put inside the formContentClass) it will have the same function name to call it.

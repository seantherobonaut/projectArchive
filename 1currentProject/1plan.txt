Test!!
		(make a package loading system eventually
			All packages are loaded automatcially maybe my php script. It seaches the directory for folders and in the subfolder a init.php
				Also..maybe have a "preDom", "DOM", and "POSTdom" folders to control what gets loaded first
				...also for the javascript...make it so the javascript that rearrachanges the pages only loads if the font loader controls the execution..no font laoder package..it loads
				...make package requirement system...some packages produce custom error if you say it requires another package...list the error output:
					"dyamicLayout requires fontLoader to run...(if packages are missing from a package...list that too"
		)
alreadye done - make it a practice... all php and js/css packages seperate ...make into module/clientOrServer

fix fontloader code (idea for later..instead of having a core.js with the resize stuff...make that resize stuff a module)

move php background check code check to the file (it will get current page then check it it has a background)...fake db
make font loader like the dynbg checking mysqldb first...fake db

make big change with the breaker divs... class (breakEvent func:stack)

the logo to shrink when it is too small...and make sure the right does not need to be posisiton absolute

(already done, bring him over again to see how he likes it)
bring him over and discuss mobile menu...panel come in from the side...or links just drop down like on brandons?(mentioned they need background covering)

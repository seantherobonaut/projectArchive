Yo yo! What's up Sean. My bad for taking a while to get back to you. So as far as the pages. 
For the first tab I like it how it is. Being a home/newsfeed tab with constant updates of the 
latest stuff. The second tab we could make the about tab and the studio tab into one and just 
call it studio. I'll add a little more information maybe some pics. The third tab we can 
scratch productions and make it a UsVsU tab and I'll have a music player with our new album 
and album information on it. Then the next tab will be a mic2u tab which I will gather the 
information for asap. Then the last tab would be the contact info. Is there anything you would 
say to change or add to make more efficient?

This is the all original, debut album "Not a Mixtape" by UsVsU. An independent music conglomerate 
based out of cameron park, CA. UsVsU strives to captivate and inspire listeners through high 
quality production mixed with impactful lyricism. Their goal is to incite a positive movement 
within the culture with the power of music

Dope👌🏿👌🏿 can you take off the soundcloud stuff that was previously on there?
